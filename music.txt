Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February not one of them spent with you.
Don't be so cold, we could be fire.
Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you, and when you're mine, in the world there's gonna be one less lonely girl.
Don't shed a tear. Whenever you need me, I'll be here (I'll never let you go).
Eenie meenie miney mo. Catch a bad chick by her toe. If she holla let her go.
Everything about you girl is so contagious.
For you I'd be running a thousand miles, just to get to where you are.
Girl, come a bit closer. Look in my eyes. Searching is so wrong. I'm Mr. Right.
Girl, if you follow Justin Bieber on Twitter, DM my phone number and sing just need someone who loooove when you called !
Hello, am I wrong or is the song of Justin Bieber 'Baby' you?
Hello, I'm Justin Bieber, come home with me, we can do what we want, until we wake up @ Studiomama
Hey baby I'm Bustin Drew Jieber, and I'm just like a Peppermint Altoids, small, white and curiously strong .
Hey baby let's get together as Justin Bieber and # 1 record!
Hey beautiful, would do with me if I told you that I stole Justin Bieber chapstick in there
Hey, what's your name beautiful ? Kim and yours? Justin Bieber, now forgotten, because you'll be screaming later
I can be a gentleman (gentleman), anything you want/ If I was your boyfriend (boyfriend), I'd never let you go, never let you go.
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe.
I don't know your name, but I love your smile.
I don't need nothing else. I promise girl, I swear. I just need somebody to love.
I don't want nobody when I got your body
I got my favorite girl. Not feeling, no pain, no fear, don't have a care in the world. Why would I when you are here?
I will never say never! (I will fight)/ I will fight till forever! (make it right)/ Whenever you knock me down/ I will not stay on the ground
I wish we had another time. I wish we had another place. But everything we have is stuck in the moment. And there's nothing my heart can do to fight with time and space. Because I'm still stuck in the moment with you.
I’m a really claustrophobic person to begin with. I hate elevators, especially crammed elevators. Except if it is you and me.
I'd wait on you forever and a day, hand and foot, your world is my world.
If I could just die in your arms, I wouldn't mind.
If I was your boyfriend I'd never let you go, I can take you places you ain't never been before.
If you need me, I'll come running from a thousand miles away. When you smile I smile (oh whoa).
I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool. What you expect me to do? I'm just trying to find, find, find- the sweet love of mine.
I'm not Justin Bieber, why do you say girl, I love you more than once .
I'm reaching out for you. Get me out here in the water and I… I'm overboard. And I need your love to pull me up. I can't swim on my own. It's too much. Feels like I'm drowning without your love. So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver.
I'm related to Justin Bieber ? (Why?) Whenever you close to me my heart beats and want to scream !
I'm running out of time. Where is my runaway love? Searching low and high… Know that I'm not giving up. I'd give it all up for her. But it'll never be enough. I won't stop until I find my runaway love….
In my head, we're already together.
It's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams.
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven, because when I stare in your eyes it couldn't be better.
Let the music blast. We gonna do our dance. Bring the doubters on. They don't matter at all because this life's too long, and this love's too strong. So, baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go.
Let's play doctor, come with Bieber fever and I will give you a full examination of the body!
Let's play Justin Bieber Mall Tour, is a fierce group teens, and I'm a bit ‘ of white meat !
Lets play Tiger Beat Magazine, I will be a poster of @ justinbieber, and you can beat me against the wall and make out with me
Never say never!
Oh, for you I would have done whatever. And I just can't believe we ain't together. And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losing you. I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring. And I'm in pieces, baby fix me. And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream. I'm going down, down, down, down. And I just can't believe my first love won't be around.
Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish/ There's no way that I could share you/ That would break my heart to pieces/ Honestly the truth is…/ If I could just die in your arms/ I wouldn't mind.
Oh, it's supposed to be some give and take, I know. But you're only taking and not giving anymore. So what do I do? Because I still love you… And you're the only one who can save me.
Only if you give, give your first dance to me/ Girl, I promise I'll be gentle/ I know we gotta do it slowly/ If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it)/ I'm going cherish every moment/ because it only happens once, once in a lifetime
So crazy is this thing we call love. And now that we've got it, we just can't give up.
So don't fear. Don't you worry about a thing. I am here, by you (I'll never let you go).
Step to the beat of my heart/ I don't need a whole lot/ But for you I admit I/ I'd rather give you the world/ Or we can share mine/ I know I won't be the first one/ giving you all this attention/ Baby listen/ I just need somebody to love.
Take my hand. Let's just dance. Watch my feet. Follow me. Don't be scared, girl, I'm here. If you didn't know, this is love.
Tell me what you like yeah tell me what you don't/ I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe.
There's a dream that I've been chasing. Want so badly for it to be reality. And when you hold my hand, and I understand that it's meant to be. Because, baby, when you're with me it's like an angel came by and took me to heaven. Because when I stare in your eyes it couldn't be better
They say that hate has been sent so let loose the talk of love. Before they outlaw the kiss, baby, give me one last hug.
Wanna Get Biebered?
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight/ I wanna show you all the finer things in life/ So just forget about the world, be young tonight/ I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya.
We play celebrity dogs, Papillon Justin Bieber, you can be Kardashian Boxer and I will bury my bone in your backyard !
Why can't I find you love of mine when you're standing in front of my face? Oh I, I must be blind. How did I let you get away?
You are my love, you are my heart/ And we will never ever ever be apart/ Are we an item? Girl, quit playing/ We're just friends, what are you saying?
You know you love me, I know you care. Just shout whenever, and I'll be there. You are my love, you are my heart. And we will never, ever, ever be apart.
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light.
Your lips, my biggest weakness. Shouldn't have let you know…

Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall Ain't gonna do you no good at all 'Cause once I catch ya and the kissin' starts A team o' wild horses couldn't tear us apart
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall. I will catch you.
I ain't greedy baby, all I want is all you got Oh no no, baby, I ain't askin' much of you Just a big-a, big-a, big-a hunk of love will do.
I don't want to be alone. Help me make it through the night.
I don't want to be your tiger 'cause tigers play too rough I don't want to be your lion 'cause lions ain't the kind  you love enough I just wanna be your teddy bear
I got stung by a sweet honeybee Oh what a feeling came over me It started in my eyes, crept to my head Flew to my heart til' I was stung dead!
I look at you and wham! I'm head over heels I guess that love is a banana peel
I want to take you to the heartbreak hotel get all shook up and love you tender you will be howling like a hound dog when I've finished with you.
I'm Gonna run my fingers through your long black hair and squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
I'm gonna stick like glue on you.
I'm no sandman, but I can take you to cotton candy land.
I'm not trying to be sexy. It's just my way of expressing myself when I move around.
I've got something to tell you That I think you ought to know That my eyes are on you baby
If I live to a hundred and two I won't let nobody sting me but you I'll be buzzin' around your head everyday at five And I'm never gonna leave once I arrive 'Cause I'm done, uh uh I got stung!
In your hands my heart is clay, To take and hold as you may.
It's a wonderful life
